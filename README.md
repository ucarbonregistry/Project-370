# Project-370
 Installation of Low Green House Gases (GHG) emitting rolling stock cars in metro system

 ____________
The project activity operates low GHG emitting rolling stocks having regenerative braking system in
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The project activity replaces the conventional
electrodynamic rheostatic braking technology, with regenerative braking technology fitted rolling
stocks. 

The regenerated electrical energy reduces the consumption of equivalent grid electrical energy
required by the powering trains, thereby conserving electrical energy and subsequently leading to
GHG emission reduction.

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has electrical driven Mass Rapid Transport System which
uses 4 car / 6 car / 8 car rolling stocks on different service lines. A typical rolling stock used by
DMRC consists of two units, each comprising of four / six / eight cars, having a combination of
Driving Trailer car (DT), Trailer Car (T) and a Motor Car (M). The Delhi Metro System is designed
for rolling stock where coaches are equipped with 3 phase AC traction motors with regenerative
braking system. The regenerative braking technology employed in DMRC is different from the
prevalent system adopted by metro system in the country which uses conventional electro-dynamic
rheostatic braking system. The electro-dynamic rheostatic braking system converts the kinetic energy
of decelerating Rolling stock into the thermal energy of rheostats which is dissipated as heat without
regenerating electrical energy while decelerating. Hence, the choice made by DMRC for using
regenerative braking technology displays the environmental consciousness of the management. The
technology for regenerative braking system in the rolling stock is provided by Mitsubishi Electric
Corporation, Japan without any technology transfer. The regenerative braking system works on the
principle of converting kinetic energy of the rolling stock while decelerating, into electrical energy
using 3 phase Induction motor and Variable Voltage Variable Frequency Control (VVVF)
Technology. 

In the regenerative mode, the traction motors work as generators and the ConverterInverter (CI) converts the electrical energy regenerated to Direct Current (DC). The DC is
subsequently converted to single-phase line frequency AC voltage, which is stepped up by
transformer to the level of 25 kV. The single-phase line frequency AC voltage is then fed back to the
Over Head Equipment (OHE). The regenerated electrical energy supplied back to the OHE is used
by other accelerating Rolling stock in the same service line. The regenerated electrical energy reduces
the consumption of equivalent amount of grid electrical energy which would otherwise have been
consumed by the accelerating trains, thereby conserving electrical energy and reducing GHG
emissions.

DMRC intends to include all its Rolling Stocks (except 70 Rolling Stocks as verification and issuance
of CERs of 70 Rolling Stocks under UNFCCC/GS has been already completed – PC 1351 & GS
4597) for the period 01st January, 2013 – 28th December, 2017 and all 328 Rolling Stocks (including
70 Rolling Stocks mentioned above) for the remaining period of the crediting period.

PRIOR HISTORY

The project was registered as CDM project titled, “Installation of Low Green House Gases (GHG)
emitting rolling stock cars in metro system” vide UNFCCC Ref. NO. 1351 and GS ID 4597. The
current project under UCR is extension of CDM project which has completed the 10-year crediting
period. 70 rolling stocks out of 328 were part of CDM project activity. 

Therefore, in order the avoid
double counting the 70 rolling stocks will contribute only from 29/12/2017 to 31/12/2022 in the
UCR crediting cycle.
